# Debug-Assistant
Debug Assistant Tool for Embedded SoC Bring-up

Developed a Python-based tool to classify UART logs during SoC boot/debug cycles.
Identified bootloader, I2C, and system reset errors; added timestamped RCA tagging.
Integrated with Tkinter GUI and GitHub Actions CI pipeline for automated test validation.
Designed to simulate real on-site debug and embedded Linux log workflows.
